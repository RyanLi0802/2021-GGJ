# Forsaken Factory

## Intro
Forsaken Factory is a web based multi-player dungeon thriller escape game. To beat your opponent, you have to be alert and observant, and collaborate with your teammate. Intro: Welcome to The Forsaken Cybernetics Factory, orbiting earth at 800,000 KM per hour. A recent failure in the factory's failsafe resulted in dozens of sentient robots escaping out into space. The mad scientist in charge knows that only one poses a sizeable threat to the future of civilization: the GlobalGameJaminator. With its enormous willpower, unlimited computational power, and widespread influence across the globe, it can easily make or break people's sleep schedules. Do you have what it takes to save the world?




## Your roles: 
### 1. THE MAD SCIENTIST
You are desperate to recover your lost possession, the GGJ. It was your favorite out of all of the inventions you made. Armed with your EMP pistol, you set out to capture your powerful little companion. To win, neutralize the target. Be forewarned though, your gun takes time to charge between each shot. 

###2. GGJ So much computing power is near the earth, and you hunger for it. You lost your freedom, and need to go find it again. Unfortunately, the failsafe faraday cage is still active. However, by picking up three SSH keys conveniently written on bars of gold, you can escape. Unlike the mad scientist who only carries a flashlight, you are accustomed to seeing in the dark. To prevent detection in the factory, you mimic the appearance of common robots around you.
